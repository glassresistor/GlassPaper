I couldn't sleep last night and ended up reading Amelia Greenhall's post about working with Shanley Kane.  It really pulled at my heartstrings and reminded me of why I haven't returned to the Oakland radical scene.

_We_ make heroes out of some of the most broken people in our communities.  It's natural because these people often feel the greatest drive, have some of the greatest resiliency, and can be the least flinching under pressure.  We *need* heroes because we feel small and unsafe and bullied and we want someone like ourselves to protect us.

I liked a world where Shanley would protect me.  Where the spectre of tech feminism's best "hitter" loomed over VCs and MRAs alike.

For some people, weev & Linus represent a similar sort of hero.  They both present compelling stories as the little guy sticking it to the man. And maybe all the racism/abuse is just for show.  (For people who racism is just great, weev is even more of a hero, but that's a different story.)

We like to make caricatures out of each other, detachment aids in every day life.  It's way too easy to forget we are all people. (This may sound like the worst sort of platitude, but it doesn't make it any less true.)

I'm not surprised that working with Shanley can feel like being in an abusive relationship (as Amelia felt).  Shanley has spoken openly about being in abusive relationships and its incredibly common for people to replicate behavior used on them.  Most (to all) behavior is learned and abusers have taught _me_ more than anyone else.

Abusers have taught me not to trust and to manipulate.  

To control and simulate.  

To perform, not to act.

Looking back on my life I can see ways that I've done the same kinds of things and have propped up community leaders who were even worse.  Each community has its own "hitters," people we expect to do the dirty work, and we don't want to care about fixing them back up when their job is done.

What's funny is when you've been used and abused sometimes the clearest path forward is do that it to someone else.  So if you were, say, financially abused you might make yourself feel better by financially abusing someone else.  Maybe you will even pick a better target, someone who "deserves" it, but it still becomes a pattern.

And the sad fact is once we get used to doing things we begin to rely on them.  They become the only tools we know and maybe the Law of the Instrument (everything looks like a nail to someone with a hammer) is all too humbling a lesson here.

Today we don't need more anger; we need more ways out.  I'm not going to hold hands with Weev or Linus (ever -- fuck that!) but I'm not going to hold onto rage or my heroes anymore.  My pain isn't a badge of honor: it's a problem to solve.
